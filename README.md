# This is Dulkir Mod!
## Custom animations does not work when you have oldanimations installed.

Massive thanks to Soopyboo32, Nopo, Aton, and many others for the invaluable teachings that made this possible.
They were instrumental to the design and debugging process, and I'm thankful that I've learned as much from this
as I have.

NEU and Skytils were great example mods to look for guidance from specifically, as well.
